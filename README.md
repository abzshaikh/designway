Hello

I have used HTML, SCSS, Jquery, Bootstrap and animate on scroll library for scroll animation

Challenge: 
To implement the circular orbit and animate it

I have hosted the page on netlify, you can access it by going to https://designway-test.netlify.app/
I have tried whatever i could within the time limit.
I may have missed out on some elements, but with more time i could have finished it.
Thanks for the opportunity. Cheers!!
